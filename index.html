                <p class="item-details">A platter is a large type of dishware used for serving food. It is a tray on
                    which food is displayed and served to people. Its shape can be oval, round, rectangular, or square.

                <p class="item-details">There are few things better than a summer dinner party and few things worse than
                    cooking for one. Sweating over a red-hot grill in August heat as your guests get steadily drunker
                    and hungrier makes for a truly unpleasant hosting experience.
